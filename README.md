## 🌍 Vision
To become the world’s most advanced **AI-driven city intelligence network**, enabling scalable research, transparent data enrichment, and privacy-first analytics for every city, industry, and public sector organization.

We believe the future belongs to systems that are:
- **AI-Augmented, not AI-Dependent**
- **Privacy-by-Design**
- **Model & Data Agnostic**
- **User-Owned Computation (BYOK)**

Our mission is to empower developers, analysts, and civic organizations to build **intelligence systems**, not just dashboards.
